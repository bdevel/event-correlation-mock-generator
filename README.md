# Event Correlation Mock Data Generator
Generates a dataset for use in determining event correlation.

Also could be called an "agent simulator" as you can describe how an agent
behaves during the day and reacts to certain events. Events can trigger
other events.

See `demos/daily.rb` to see syntax for chained events.
